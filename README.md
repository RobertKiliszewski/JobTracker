# JobTrackerApp
JobTrackerApp is an application used mainly for users to be able to calculate their income based on their hours as well as their hourly rate.

I have developed my application in Java using MySQL as a databse.


# System Requirements
1. Windows 7 and above
2. Java

# How to use

When opening the app the user is presented with a login screen.

The user will be asked to input their Username and Password but since they do not have an account when they click login the will be presented with a error message saying that they entered wrong credentials.

Following that they will need to Register their new Account where they will need to enter their work place, username, password, name and surname.

If their username already exists they will need to make a unique username in order to create the account

After a successful user creation and login, the user will be brought to the main page where they will be asked to input many things in order to get a calculation.

In this Window the user is asked for their rate as a decimal number(eg.9.50) or full number(eg.12) depending on their hourly rate
